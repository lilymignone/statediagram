This diagram represents a traffic light control system at the Gishushu intersection, designed to manage traffic flow and pedestrian crossings in all directions. It shows a sequence of traffic light and pedestrian signal phases that operate in a cyclic pattern, with specific timings for each phase.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the flow:

North-South Traffic:
Starts with a green light for north-south traffic for 60 seconds, allowing vehicles to move in the north-south direction.
After 60 seconds, the light changes to yellow for 5 seconds to prepare for a stop.
The light then turns red, stopping north-south traffic.
Pedestrian Crossing for North-South:
Once north-south traffic stops, a pedestrian walk signal is activated for pedestrians crossing in the north-south direction.
This pedestrian phase continues until all pedestrians have crossed, after which the cycle moves to the next traffic direction.
East-West Traffic:
The east-west traffic light turns green for 60 seconds, allowing vehicles to proceed in the east-west direction.
After 60 seconds, the light changes to yellow for 5 seconds before turning red.
Pedestrian Crossing for East-West:
After east-west traffic stops, a pedestrian signal is activated for those crossing in the east-west direction.
Once pedestrians complete crossing, the cycle continues to the next direction.
West-East Traffic:
The west-east traffic light follows, turning green for 60 seconds, followed by a 5-second yellow light, and then red.
Pedestrian Crossing for West-East:
A pedestrian signal is activated after west-east traffic stops, allowing pedestrians to cross in that direction.
The system waits for pedestrians to finish crossing before proceeding.
East-South Traffic:
East-south traffic lights turn green for 60 seconds, followed by a 5-second yellow signal, then red.
Pedestrian Crossing for East-South:
Once east-south traffic stops, a pedestrian walk signal is activated for pedestrians crossing in this direction.
Pedestrians complete crossing before moving to the final phase.
South-East Traffic:
The south-east light turns green for 60 seconds, followed by yellow for 5 seconds, and then red.
Pedestrian Crossing for South-East:
A pedestrian signal allows pedestrians to cross after south-east traffic stops, completing the cycle.
Cycle Repeats:
After the south-east pedestrian crossing, the cycle resets, and traffic flow returns to the initial north-south phase.
Each traffic phase is synchronized to ensure that vehicles in only one direction move at a time, while pedestrian phases are interspersed to provide safe crossing times in between vehicle flows. The cyclic structure helps to manage the intersection efficiently, reducing potential conflicts between vehicle flows and pedestrian crossings.
